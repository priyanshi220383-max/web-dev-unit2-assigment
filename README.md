This project is my Personal Portfolio Website, created as part of my web development assignment. It showcases my profile, skills, projects, and contact information in a clean and user-friendly layout. The goal of this assignment is to design a simple yet attractive website using HTML and External CSS to demonstrate web design fundamentals and styling techniques.I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Pratik Raj Sir for his continuous guidance, support, and encouragement throughout this project. His clear explanations and valuable feedback helped me understand web development concepts effectively and complete this assignment successfully.
